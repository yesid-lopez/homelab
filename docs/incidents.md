# Incidents log

Chronological record of homelab incidents, their root causes and the fixes applied. Newest entry on top.

For repo-level tech debt (things that are intentional-but-suboptimal) see [debt-tech.md](debt-tech.md).

Every entry follows the same shape:

- **Symptoms** — what was observed.
- **Root cause** — what was actually broken.
- **Changes** — commands / files / manifests touched. Distinguishes **host-level** (SSH into a node, not managed by GitOps) from **repo-level** (committed to the repo, reconciled by Flux).
- **Verification** — how to confirm the fix in the future.
- **Follow-ups** — anything intentionally deferred.

## 2026-07-18 — `master-1` (Minisforum UM690) random hard resets

### Symptoms

- `master-1` powered off abruptly at unpredictable intervals (8 resets in 40 min on 2026-07-09, then every 1–3 h during 07-10 → 07-12).
- No clean shutdown recorded: `last -x shutdown` had no entries matching the reboots, and `journalctl -b -1` ended mid-log with no `Stopping…` messages.
- User observation that unlocked the diagnosis: **with the ethernet cable unplugged the machine stayed up indefinitely**.

### Root cause

- **Primary**: NIC is a Realtek RTL8125 2.5GbE using the in-tree `r8169` driver on kernel 6.8.0-124. This combination has known issues with TCP segmentation offloads (TSO/GSO/GRO) and Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) that cause interrupt storms and hard CPU lockups under sustained traffic. With `kernel.panic=10` set, the hardware watchdog / kernel forced a reset before anything could be flushed to the journal — hence the lack of shutdown logs. Cable unplugged → no traffic → no storm → no reset.
- **Contributing** (did not cause the resets, but made the host unhealthy):
    - k3s cluster certificates expired on 2026-06-18 → apiserver in an infinite error loop.
    - `fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 128` (Ubuntu default) → k3s spammed `error creating fsnotify watcher: too many open files` every second.
    - No swap configured on a 16 GB host running k3s + Longhorn + Prometheus.

### Changes

All changes are **host-level on `master-1` (192.168.2.108)**; nothing was committed to the repo/GitOps flow. Applied via `sudo` over SSH.

1. **NIC workaround** — runtime + persisted:

```bash
ethtool -K eno1 tso off gso off gro off
ethtool --set-eee eno1 eee off
```

   Persisted via a new systemd unit `/etc/systemd/system/r8169-fix.service` (enabled, `WantedBy=multi-user.target`) that re-runs both `ethtool` calls after `network-online.target` on every boot.

2. **Sysctl limits** — `/etc/sysctl.d/99-homelab-k3s.conf`:

```
fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 8192
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288
fs.file-max = 2097152
```

3. **Swap** — 4 GiB swapfile at `/swapfile`, added to `/etc/fstab` as `/swapfile none swap sw 0 0`.

4. **k3s certificate rotation**:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop k3s
sudo k3s certificate rotate         # rotates server, api-server, admin, etcd, scheduler, kubelet, auth-proxy, kube-proxy
sudo systemctl start k3s
```

   New certs valid until **2027-07-18**. Old certs backed up under `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls-<epoch>/`.

5. **Persistent journal** — `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` set to `Storage=persistent`, `SystemMaxUse=2G`; `/var/log/journal/` created. This is so the *next* crash (if any) survives the reboot and can be inspected with `journalctl -b -1 -k`.

6. **Local `~/.kube/config` on the Mac** — after cert rotation, the local kubeconfig for context `bramble` had to be updated with the new CA/client cert/key (`kubectl config set clusters.bramble.certificate-authority-data …` and friends). Previous config backed up as `~/.kube/config.bak.<epoch>`.

### Verification

- `systemctl is-enabled r8169-fix.service` → `enabled`
- `ethtool -k eno1 | grep -E 'tcp-segmentation|generic-segmentation|generic-receive'` → all `off`
- `ethtool --show-eee eno1` → `EEE status: disabled`
- `sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances` → `8192`
- `swapon --show` → `/swapfile 4G`
- `sudo openssl x509 -in /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/serving-kube-apiserver.crt -noout -enddate` → `notAfter=Jul 18 …  2027`
- `kubectl get nodes` shows both `master-1` and `worker` as `Ready` from the Mac.
- Track uptime with `uptime` over the following days; expect it to grow past the previous 1–3 h ceiling.

### Follow-ups

- If resets return despite the NIC workaround, install Realtek's out-of-tree driver `r8125-dkms` (upstream fork with more fixes than in-tree `r8169`).
- Set a calendar reminder ~2027-05 to rotate k3s certs again (they auto-rotate on restart if within 90 days of expiry, but only if k3s is actually restarted — otherwise the same silent expiry can happen again).
- One external client (IP `192.168.2.208` = `worker` / `luloclaw`) was intermittently presenting the old client cert (SN `8016972684918034376`) after rotation. Node was `Ready` so it self-recovered, but if the noise persists, restart the k3s-agent on `luloclaw` to force a fresh kubelet-client cert.
- The `apps/production/*` and `infrastructure/*` GitOps tree was **not** touched; all fixes are host-level. If master-1 is ever reprovisioned, these host tweaks must be re-applied manually (or better: put them into a small provisioning script / cloud-init).
